      <description>Work Summary  Examined the effects of situational urgency on drivers’ collision avoidance behaviors using Tongji University&amp;rsquo;s eight-degree-of-freedom driving simulator. Developed a kinematic-based forward collision warning (FCW) algorithm that is compatible with drivers’ risk perceptions and behavioral responses. Implemented the proposed FCW algorithm in Tongji University driving simulator, and evaluated the system&amp;rsquo;s performance, warning timing, and safety benefits.  Introduction Driving Behavior Research for Intelligent Collision Avoidance Technology is a driving simulator study jointly conducted by Tongji University and China First Automobile Work (FAW) Corporation (one of the largest automobile companies in China).</description>
