      <description>Work Summary  Collected 60 Chinese drivers’ real-world driving data, with a total mileage of 161,055 km. Investigated decision-making mechanisms for essential driving behaviors based on 108,933 car-following events, 17,309 lane-change events, 7,845 cut-in events, and 3,256 vehicle-pedestrian conflicts. Calibrated, validated, and cross-compared five representative car-following models and found that the full velocity difference model performed best for Shanghai drivers. Investigated the impact of a forward collision warning system on drivers’ car following behavior.</description>

      <title>AlphaDrive: Mastering Driving with Real-World Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://MeixinZhu.github.io/project/alphadrive/</link>

      <description>I am currently working on developing AlphaDrive, a platform equipped with real-world driving scenarios where intelligent agents can learn to drive by trial and error, trials and errors that number in the billions. The platform is comprised of three main modules:
 Driving Scenario Database: containing typical driving scenarios (e.g., car following, lane changing, overtaking, and vehicle-pedestrian conflicts) extracted from naturalistic driving studies or field operation test databases. Microscopic Traffic Simulator: loading driving scenarios, executing given driving policies and returning their performance indicators.</description>

      <title>Driving Behavior Research for Intelligent Collision Avoidance Technology</title>
      <link>https://MeixinZhu.github.io/project/faw/</link>

      <description>Work Summary  Examined the effects of situational urgency on drivers’ collision avoidance behaviors using Tongji University&amp;rsquo;s eight-degree-of-freedom driving simulator. Developed a kinematic-based forward collision warning (FCW) algorithm that is compatible with drivers’ risk perceptions and behavioral responses. Implemented the proposed FCW algorithm in Tongji University driving simulator, and evaluated the system&amp;rsquo;s performance, warning timing, and safety benefits.  Introduction Driving Behavior Research for Intelligent Collision Avoidance Technology is a driving simulator study jointly conducted by Tongji University and China First Automobile Work (FAW) Corporation (one of the largest automobile companies in China).</description>

      <title>Optimized Design for Combined Road Alignment</title>
      <link>https://MeixinZhu.github.io/project/design/</link>

      <description>Combined horizontal and vertical alignments are frequently used in mountainous freeways in China; however, design guidelines that consider the safety impact of combined alignments are not currently available. This project aims to estimate the effects of combined alignments on driving behavior (e.g., speed and lateral acceleration) and safety performance (crash surrogate measures like lane departure events and emergency braking events) using a driving simulator and field data. The results will assist engineers to design safer mountainous freeways.</description>
