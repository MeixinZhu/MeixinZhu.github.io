      <description>Work Summary  Collected 60 Chinese drivers’ real-world driving data, with a total mileage of 161,055 km. Investigated decision-making mechanisms for essential driving behaviors based on 108,933 car-following events, 17,309 lane-change events, 7,845 cut-in events, and 3,256 vehicle-pedestrian conflicts. Calibrated, validated, and cross-compared five representative car-following models and found that the full velocity difference model performed best for Shanghai drivers. Investigated the impact of a forward collision warning system on drivers’ car following behavior.</description>

      <title>AlphaDrive: Mastering Driving with Real-World Driving Scenarios</title>

      <description>I am currently working on developing AlphaDrive, a platform equipped with real-world driving scenarios where intelligent agents can learn to drive by trial and error, trials and errors that number in the billions. The platform is comprised of three main modules:
 Driving Scenario Database: containing typical driving scenarios (e.g., car following, lane changing, overtaking, and vehicle-pedestrian conflicts) extracted from naturalistic driving studies or field operation test databases. Microscopic Traffic Simulator: loading driving scenarios, executing given driving policies and returning their performance indicators.</description>

      <description>The National Surface Transportation Safety Center for Excellence (NSTSCE) at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) hosted the Fifth International Symposium on Naturalistic Driving Research at The Inn at Virginia Tech and Skelton Conference Center in Blacksburg, Virginia on August 30-31, 2016, with the Motorcycle Research and Technology Workshop and Women in Transportation Seminar – The Future of Transportation following on September 1.
The symposium provided researchers and practitioners with an overview of international naturalistic driving studies, a method designed to track driver behavior in real-time.</description>
